# Radiation Belts

Welcome to the **Radiation Belts** - a GitHub page and organization!

## About

The Radiation Belts page serves as a collaborative hub for developing and sharing codes related to radiation belt physics and space science. The projects hosted here can be written in any programming language and can be in any stage of development.

For Python-based projects, we encourage you to join the [**Python in Heliophysics Community**](https://heliopython.org/)  once your code meets their standards.

### Our Goal
We aim to make it easier for anyone in the space science community to **discover** relevant projects and **collaborate** on the development.
